**Invisibility Cloak**

this small project implements invisibility cloak like in harry potter! you can experiment with it too.
for this to work you need to have a blue or green (white and red color is implemented also but doesn't work well) piece of cloth. 
1. first you need to install required libraries (make sure python is alread installed on system)
   ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
2. run the script with the following command
   ``` python invisible_cloak.py --cloth_color <your cloth color>```
   green and blue works best!
